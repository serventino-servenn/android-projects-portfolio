## Android Projects Portfolio

A collection of Android projects showcasing my journey from learning Kotlin and Jetpack Compose fundamentals to implementing modern app architecture through hands-on, independent development.

The projects are arranged from **beginner to intermediate/advanced**, reflecting my growing competency in:
*   **UI Design:** Jetpack Compose, Material 3, adaptive layouts
*   **Architecture:** MVVM, Repository Pattern, unidirectional data flow
*   **Data:** Networking (Retrofit), local persistence (Room, DataStore)
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Coroutines & StateFlow
*   **Testing:** Unit testing (JUnit)

## Inspiration & Learning
These projects were initially inspired by the curriculum of [Android Basics with Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course). Each project was then **extended, customized, and architected independently** to explore advanced concepts, deeper architecture, and personal design choices beyond the initial scope.

This portfolio demonstrates my systematic progression from **basic Compose UI skills** to **integrating complex data sources and building adaptive, production-ready applications**, showcasing my practical readiness for a **Junior Android Developer** role.
